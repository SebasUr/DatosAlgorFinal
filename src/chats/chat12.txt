Person 1: Hey.
Person 2: Hey.
Person 1: So, how's it going?
Person 2: Fine. Just fine. I really hate you.
Person 1: Cool, cool. Anything new with you? Remember that I hate you too.
Person 2: Not really. Same old, same old.
Person 1: Right. So, have you been up to anything interesting lately?
Person 2: Not really interested in sharing my life story with you.
Person 1: Okay, got it. No need to be so defensive.
Person 2: Defensive? I'm just not into small talk, that's all.
Person 1: Fair enough. We don't have to talk if you don't want to. IÂ´d kill you.
Person 2: Works for me.
Person 1: Well, it's been great catching up. I hate you.
Person 2: If you say so.
Person 1: Is there something bothering you? You seem a bit off.
Person 2: Nothing's bothering me. I just don't feel like chatting.
Person 1: Alright, I'll leave you be then. So you want to kill me.
Person 2: Finally, some understanding.
Person 1: I wasn't trying to annoy you.
Person 2: Well, you are.
Person 1: I can't help if I don't know what's wrong.
Person 2: Figure it out.
Person 1: I don't have time for this attitude.
Person 2: Good, then leave. 
Person 1: We used to get along. What happened?
Person 2: People change. Get used to it.
Person 1: Fine, if that's how you want it.
Person 2: It is.
Person 1: I thought we could at least be civil.
Person 2: Civility is overrated.
Person 1: It's like talking to a brick wall.
Person 2: You're the one who keeps talking.
Person 1: This conversation is going nowhere.
Person 2: Should've realized that earlier.
Person 1: Alright, I'm done. Take care.
Person 2: Finally, some peace and quiet.
