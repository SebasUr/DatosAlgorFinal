Person 1: Hey.
Person 2: Hey.
Person 1: So, about that project. We need to get on the same page.
Person 2: I don't see why. I'm handling my part just fine.
Person 1: Your part is affecting the entire project. We need collaboration.
Person 2: I work better alone. Don't need someone slowing me down.
Person 1: This is a team effort. Your attitude is creating tension.
Person 2: Tension? Maybe you're just too sensitive.
Person 1: It's about professionalism. We should be able to work together.
Person 2: I don't have time for your lectures. Let me do my job.
Person 1: Your job affects mine. It's hard to work when there's no communication.
Person 2: Communication is overrated. I deliver results, not small talk.
Person 1: Results matter, but so does teamwork. We're all in this together.
Person 2: I don't need a lecture on teamwork from you.
Person 1: It's not a lecture; it's a reality check. We're failing as a team.
Person 2: Failure is subjective. I'm doing just fine on my own.
Person 1: This project is about the collective effort, not individual achievements.
Person 2: I don't care about your philosophy. Just let me work in peace.
Person 1: Peace is impossible when there's a lack of cooperation.
Person 2: Cooperation is overrated. I'm not here to make friends.
Person 1: You don't have to be friends, but we need to be professional.
Person 2: Professionalism is just a mask people wear. I'm real.
Person 1: Real or not, we have a project deadline. We need to find common ground.
Person 2: Common ground is overrated. I'll meet the deadline on my own.
Person 1: Meeting the deadline is crucial, but so is maintaining a healthy team dynamic.
Person 2: Team dynamics won't get the job done. Results speak louder.
Person 1: Results matter, but so does how we achieve them. Let's find a middle ground.
Person 2: Middle ground is a compromise. I don't compromise my standards.
Person 1: It's not about compromising standards; it's about finding a way to work together.
Person 2: I work alone. Get used to it.
